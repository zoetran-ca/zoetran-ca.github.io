# About ðŸ‘‹

## Welcome

My name is Diep Tran (Zoe). I love it when Iâ€™m able to play with data and see something useful that no one has ever seen before.

I created this website to showcase some side projects and real-life client projects Iâ€™ve done when exploring a career in Data Analysis &amp; Business Intelligence (DABI).

I hope you enjoy the projects, and we may even get connected.

## Background

Business Intelligence has never been my first choice but Iâ€™m excited I got here. Previously, I was trained in political science and worked in several positions from research to operation management.

Three years ago I assisted a five-year research project in data analysis tasks, and found DABI a great fit to me. I enjoy the work of helping organizations leverage software and services to quickly transform data into actionable insights that inform strategic, tactical, and operational decisions, "What it was, what it is, what it will be."

I then decided to pivot my career combining business, data, and communication to work in the field of Data Analysis/ Business Intelligence.

## Skills

Identifying Business Issues and Turning into Analytical Questions: I always try to crystallize two things: purposes and context. Why do my clients need what theyâ€™re asking me to do? and in what context does the need hold? Once these two questions are set clear, the rest will follow.

**Excel**: work with small data, develop good data habits, prototype reports and dashboards.

**SQL**: work with big data, integrate data sources, deeply understand data modelling, expertly turn questions into queries, automate data steps to pursue readability, traceability and reproducibility.

**Tableau**: know when to use what chart to visualize metrics by dimensions: line (trend of time series), pie (part-to-whole relationship), column/bar (comparison), histogram (distribution), scatterplot (correlation).

**Power BI**: use Query Editor to connect to 100+ data sources and clean up data, use Model to build relationships between tables and data analysis expressions (DAX), quickly put together a self-service BI, provide business with a 360Â° view of how business is doing and where it is going.

## Traits

**Curious**: Iâ€™m curious about how things work. All the time.

**Take ownership**: I care. I take ownership in what I do. Iâ€™m committed and deliver quality.

**Effective**: Whenever I can, I automate things. Automation is my friend.

**Technical Sophistication**: I Google and figure things out myself, or ask around for solutions.

**Positive Attitude**: Programming teaches me to break a giant problem into small steps, and tackle them one by one. Iâ€™m positive as I know I will get there.

**Fix it twice**: Iâ€™m all about process improvement.
